![About Me](/images/about/about_me.png)

Hi, Iâ€™m Caio Yassoyama, an Android developer and passionate about technology and quality software.  
This blog is where I share my personal experiences, most about Android development, clean code and best practices.

This blog is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  
This Jekyll theme ([Pixyll](http://pixyll.com)) was crafted with <3 by [John Otander](http://johnotander.com).
